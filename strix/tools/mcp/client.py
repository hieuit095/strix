"""Connect to MCP servers so a run can reach their tools on demand.

Given one :class:`McpConnectionConfig` per server, :func:`connect_mcp_servers`
connects each server, counts the tools it offers (honoring the connection's
allowlist), and returns the live sessions. It does NOT register anything as an
agent tool: under the generic-dispatch model the run holds these sessions in a
per-run :class:`~strix.tools.mcp.registry.McpRegistry`, and the agent reaches
them through the two dispatch tools (``describe_mcp`` / ``call_mcp``), which call
the session's shared dispatch function to run one tool and serialize its result.

A server that cannot connect is logged and skipped, so one bad connection never
fails the run.
